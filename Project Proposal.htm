        <h1> Project Proposal: GetHangry.com</h1>
<hr> 

<h2> What is your website about? </h2> 
<p> One year ago, I launched an instagram account called @get-hangry which is a compilation of photos of the food I eat. Eating, is my favorite hobby and this food instagram has allowed me to share my love of food with other "foodies" and people who love food. I have made many friends through my instagram account and have bonded with many others who have similar accounts. It is time to take my instagram account to the next level, by making a proper foodblog. </p> 
<p> You can look at the instagram account <a href="http://www.instagram.com/get_hangry/">here</a> </p> 
<h2> What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?) </h2> 
<p> The objective of the website is to cater to those who are passionate about food but may want to read or see more than a photo on instagram. The food blog will also contain more than just pictures of food. My goal is for the blog to encompass everything that is food, from food-themed clothing to songs about food. The blog will attract people who are as passionate about food as I am. 
<h2> Who is your target audience set. </h2> 
<p> The target audience is composed of those who are already following the instagram account @get-hangry and also trying to reach other peolpe who are interested in a more in depth blog than a brief synopsis on instagram. </p> 
<h2> What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2> 
<p> The website will have various links under different headings. The main page will include a map where a user can look at the different restaurants I have been to in various cities. The two main cities where I have taken photos are Boston (where I currently reside) and Miami (where I am from). Additionally, there will be a link to include home-made recipes and ideas that I will add a few of my own recipes as well as my mother's who is a very great cook. Another link I hope to have would be a compilation of food in Fashion. This will include links to other websites where you can purchase the clothing as well as a photo as to how I would wear the article of clothing. As a last link, there will be a place linking to current events about food in mainstream media and culture. This will include links to buzfeed articles (why I like the article) and food in current events.
